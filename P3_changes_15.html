            <h2>Significant Changes</h2>
            <p><b>Changes to index.html:</b> We changed where clicking on the image of Nala takes the user. Insted 
                of taking the the user to gallery.html, the user gets sent to the content section at the bottom of the 
                homepage, where they can get an overview of the website's content. We did this by having the value of 
                the "href" attribute set as the ID of the content-section-element. Presicely "href='#contentContainer'". 
                This makes it easier for the user to find this section where they can get an overview of the content.
            </p>
            <p><b>Changes to diet.html:</b> On the diet page we decided to add a daily plan element. The reason we added 
                this element was to give the page a better structure, and to show the user where the plan is going to be 
                displayed. We styled it equal to the “Unsafe foods” element, with a pink background color. We also added 
                dog footprints as bullet lists for the meals, to make the plan more appealing to children. Except for that, 
                the page is very similar compared to the description in P2.
            </p>
            <p><b>Changes to breed.html:</b> The breed pages look largely similar to the previously proposed design, however 
                when the page becomes smaller, some of the elements has to stack on top of each other before turning into 
                a more linear format at max-width: 950px. At 1350 px the two visual elements start to clash so they are 
                stacked adding another responsive breaking point on this page. The font used for the traits was also changed 
                as it was deemed good to have some variety to draw attention to the visual element and its importance. The 
                font was changed to ‘Courier New’ as this font seemed different enough from the main text but still not flashy 
                or dramatic.
            </p>
            <p><b>Changes to gallery.html:</b> We added slidershow and showcase for when a picture or video is clicked as 
                intended. But we added some extra features. When a video is clicked, it will autostart the video. If wanting 
                to add more picture is requested, it would be easy to add a picture, by just adding the picture in the images 
                folder with the right name and edit one variable on the slideshow.js file that defines how many pictures is in 
                the gallery. There is also an compatability feature were the videos is algined vertically if nessesary. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Changes to age-calculator.html:</b> We changed the background-color of the output-field, so it's easier for the 
                user to see if they got an error message because of wrong inputs in the calculator (red background), or if they got
                a correct age as output (green background).
            </p>
            <p><b>Changes to contact.html:</b> We added javascript functionality to the FAQ section. While it was intended in P2 
                that the FAQ elements would have a dropdown feature, it was not intended that this feeature would be created with 
                javascript. However, we decided to use javascript to reduce the amount of code needed to add new questions. Instead 
                of needing to write a new div element and the corresponding children elements to that div for each FAQ question, 
                you simply only have to add the question text and awnser text to the "faqContent" object in content.js.
            </p>
            <p><b>Changes to stylesheet.css:</b> We reduced the font size of the p elements from 1.2em to 1.1em, and h1 font size from 
                3em to 2.5em. We also changed the font in the navbar from 1.6em to 0.8em. The reason we changed all the fonts was because 
                the text looked out of proportion compared to the rest of the content, so we needed to size it down. In P2 we wrote that 
                Roboto was going to be our default font on the page. After trying some different styles, we decided to instead go with Arial 
                as default font and Roboto for titles and subtitles. The reason behind this decision was that the Roboto font did not look so 
                good on longer paragraphs. In P2 we also wrote that the body background was going to be the beige color #EFE2BA. While coding 
                the website we found out that this color did not belong to the color scheme we had chosen. We therefore changed it to a 
                lighter beige (#FAF0CA), the color we were supposed to use all along.  The box elements with text were also supposed to 
                have a different background color than we wrote in P2. So we changed it to the light pink color #FFF1F8, instead of white.

            <h2>How we fulfilled minimum requirements</h2>
            <p>
                Ulrik fulfilled his javascript requirement by creating a function on the homepage that shows the 
                user how old Nala is, to the second, using the date-object and the setInterval function. The 
                function worked as intended and updates every 1000 milliseconds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Julian fulfilled his minimum requirement by programming the whole script for the age-calculator. 
                He used regression to find the best suitable age-formula for each dog weight-class. The age-calculator 
                will also let the user know if they forgot to fill out certain inputs or if the inputs they filled in 
                are outside of the calculator's range.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Sondre fulfilled his javascript requirement by making an own blackscreen element with img and video element 
                inside with display none with animation instead of using existing elements and adding animations on them. 
                Sondre fulfilled the dynamical display of images, although we decided that we should not have static sizes 
                to images and videos, instead the pictures have a 10% and videos have 17% width size every time. The size of 
                the images and videos has also changed when clicked. Instead of 70% x 70%, it has max 90% where it autoscales 
                to make the images and videos more friendly to watch. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                Billy fulfilled his javascript requirement through the function that sends the user to a formatted email 
                th text, subject matter and mailto email address. This changed from the original plan for the contact 
                opportunities as no response is directly given from the website. Rather the user's email service of 
                choice is able to confirm that the email was sent. The function also makes sure that submission of the 
                contact form can’t be completed unless both subject and message contains at least some content. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Jakob fulfilled his minimum requirements by using javascript to generate the meal plan based on the 
                user input on the diet.html page. Javascript was also used to start the spinning animation that takes 
                place before the plan is displayed. The plan also updates itself automatically if some of the input is 
                changed, based on the inbuilt event listener function in Javascript.

                Mostly we stuck to doing everything we planned in P2, but some changes occured while coding 
                the website. Julian, Billy and Ulrik ended up coding the contact.html site instead of Julian 
                and Sondre. Also Sondre and Jakob coded the footer&header.js, and not everyone which we wrote 
                in P2. On the contact.js javascript file, Sondre, Julian, Billy and Ulrik all worked together, 
                instead of only Billy. Apart from that, everyone did what we planned in the P2 document.

            <h2>Modularity</h2>
            <p>
                Sondre and Ulrik were responsible for the modularity of the project. 
                They created a javascript script for each sub-page and a script that 
                every sub-page used called “footer&header.js”. This script was responsible 
                for creating a navbar, dropdown menu and a footer for every sub-page 
                (including the home page) in the website using javascript, so that we didn't 
                need to write the same code for the navbar and the footer for every sub-page. 
                Furthermore, we used a single stylesheet called “stylesheet.css” to style the 
                website. On this stylesheet, some fundamental commonalities across the website 
                were declared such as font family and font size for header and body text 
                elements as well as background colour. Another modular implementation Sondre 
                did on “footer&header.js” was to simplify the workflow to add more pages. The 
                solution is to just add the name and url to the new page to an existing array. 
                With “Contact.js” and the DOM Ulrik added code reusability to “contact.html” 
                for the frequently asked questions section. With “Slideshow.js” and Sondre 
                implemented reusability to “gallery.html” for how many pictures the gallery can show.
