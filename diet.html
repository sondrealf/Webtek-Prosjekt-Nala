                        <h3>Nalas diet</h3>
                        <p>
                            Since Nala is only 18 months old and a very small dog, that is taken into consideration when feeding her. Usually she eats four meals a day, two 
                            consisting of kibble and the other two being either bread or leftovers. The reason she eats four meals a day is due to her young age. You maybe think 
                            that she eats a lot for her age and size, but Nala is a very active dog, who burns a lot of calories. She is walking at least 1.5 hours a day, and also run 
                            around and plays all the time. <b>Use the diet-calculator to get a meal plan for your dog.</b>

                        <h3>What should a diet consist of?</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are plenty of different diets that you can give your dog. It is important to understand that every dog is different, and that you should always 
                            see how your dog reacts to different foods. There are still some guidelines that we can give you to help optimize the diet. Some important factors 
                            are how old the dog is, what size it is, which breed and how active the dog is. If you want, you can choose to feed your dog with a pure kibble diet, 
                            or you can mix it up with some human food. It is important to always make sure your dog is well hydrated, and that it has access to water at all times. 
                            <br><br>
                            When it comes to the amount, it depends on the factors mentioned above. But generally should puppies eat many small meals a day, and adults can stick 
                            to fewer bigger meals. You should wait to introduce human foods until the dog is 4 months old, then it is safe to introduce it slowly. Some examples
                            can be raw meat and raw meaty bones. When deciding the amount it is also important to take a look at your dog, and make sure it is not underfeed or overfeed.
                            For more detailed information about your dog's health, you should seek medical advice from your vet, who can weigh your dog and provide you with a body condition 
                            score.
                            <br><br>
                            When feeding your dog, not every human food is safe for them to eat. Some food can be very toxic, and in some cases can lead to serious poisoning and even death. 
                            Chocolate, onions, garlic, lactose, alcohol, fatty and salty foods are some examples of foods you should never feed your dog. <b>Under "Unsafe foods for dogs" you can learn more about 
                            what to do if your dog eats a toxic food.</b>
